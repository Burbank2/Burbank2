Unveiling the Mystery: Who’s Behind the Code? 🧐

Hello, it’s Mike! My journey has taken me from:
  flipping burgers,
  to serving in the Army,
  to retail,
  and now,
  to the exhilarating world of coding. 
  Each step has shaped me, and my creative spirit has been my compass.
  Now, l’m navigating the developer landscape,
  one line of code at a time. 
  Delighted to connect with you!
